## Pickup Driver Details View

ESP has two employees in the city who do local parts pickup from their suppliers and receiving at the end of the day. Each driver covers a different area of the city, and they begin the morning by dividing the pickups and summarizing their pickup sheets. By mid-morning, they head out to do their pickups and they return by mid-afternoon, at which time they check in their pickup sheets and stock the shelves.

The following is a sample pickup sheet for one of the drivers.
