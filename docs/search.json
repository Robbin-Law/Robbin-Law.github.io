Allow all the defaults on download. The path should be updated automatically, so that git is available from any directory.\nOpen a PowerShell or CMD terminal. In the shell run git -–version to make sure that git is installed and accessible from this directory. Note that it is two minus bars before version. If a version number is not returned, the path must be set so that git is available from any directory. To set the path, in the search area at the bottom of the windows task bar type env and select Edit Environment Variables for your Account. Then edit the PATH and add new C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd. You could add this to the system environments alternatively. Now you can run the git command from a terminal anywhere.\n\n\n\nDownload and Install GitHub CLI\n\nGitHub CLI Website\nDownload the latest version. Allow all the defaults on download.

    "text": "Basic Git Commands\nWe can use the git version control application directly from the command line. Here are some useful commands to get started.\n\ngit init - This command will create a git repository in the current folder on your machine.\n\nThe best way to create a repo is to do it on github via a browser. Once this is done you can clone the repo to your machine. Make your working folder where you want the repo stored and run the following command.\n\ngit clone UrlOfRepoOnGithub.\n\nYou will have had to copy the url of the github repo to the clipboard. Then use the following command to clone. This url is just an example. You would copy the clipboard to the command line.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/RobbinLawComputerEngineering/Semiconductors-Public.git.\n\nOnce your github repo is cloned down to your machine you can start adding folders and files to the repo, and changing what is already in the repo.\nWhen you make an addition or change to a file, always SAVE it, then use the following command to see that git knows there has been a change.\n\ngit status - This will give you the current status of your local git repository.\n\nAt this point the changed files names will be red.\nThe next thing is that you have to stage your changes.\n\ngit add . - Use this command to “stage” all of your current changes so that they are ready to be committed.\ngit status will show that the changed files are staged by turning the file names green from red.\n\nNow you are ready to commit the recent changes.\n\ngit commit -m \"Your Message\" - This command will take all of the staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commits is how we generate a commit history for our repository. The message is NOT optional.\n\nFinally you will want to update your github repo with the changes made on you machines local repo. You can have many commits to one push.\n\ngit push - This command will take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.com.\n\nIf you are working with others and someone changes the github repo, you will have to pull to get those changes on your machine.\n\ngit pull - Use this command to grab any changes from your remote repository (e.g.: GitHub.com) and pull them down onto your local repository (the one on your computer). The pull command is a combination of git fetch and git merge commands.\n\nAnother great command to see what is going on.\n\ngit log - This will give you the history of your git repository\n\nThere are a lot of things to learn when it comes to working with git, but these commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do as you work with version control."

    "text": "Passive Components vs. Active Components\n\nPassive Components\nIn a previous course, you worked with a group of electrical components that we refer to as Passive Components – components that behave according to simple mathematical relationships in response to changes in the rest of the circuitry.  For example, unless you push it beyond its limits, a resistor will always behave very nearly as predicted by\n\\(V=IR\\)\nA capacitor will always respond very nearly as predicted by\n\\(‌i_C=C(dv/dt)\\)\nAn inductor will always respond very nearly as predicted by\n\\(‌v_L=L(di/dt)\\)\nBoth the capacitor and inductor, as predicted by their basic formulas, will generate exponential charging functions when placed in series with a resistor and powered by a fixed voltage source.\nBy the way, the “very nearly” caveats in the preceding description is an important indication that, by developing these formulas, we are creating simplified mathematical models of real devices.  Real devices do other things that we don’t include in our models.  For example, the resistance of a resistor changes with temperature, and temperature changes with current, something Ohm’s Law by itself doesn’t account for.  Capacitors usually have a small leakage current which means the total current for charging a capacitor will be slightly greater than what is predicted by the model.  Inductors are plagued by residual magnetism which means they don’t respond instantaneously to changes in the circuit as predicted by our mathematical model.  However, the formulas we use to model the activity of these passive components is usually good enough for the work we’re doing.\n\n\nActive Components\nActive Components, on the other hand, behave differently for different conditions in a circuit.  The diode is the simplest of the active components.  Other examples that we will study in this course are transistors and operational amplifiers.",

    "section": "Insulators, Conductors, and Semiconductors",
    "text": "Insulators, Conductors, and Semiconductors\nOn a Periodic Table of the Elements, materials fall into three general categories.  Most of the left and central part of the periodic table consists of metals, which conduct electricity and react with non-metals to form Ionic Bonds.  On the right side are the non-metals, which do not readily conduct electricity. Most of these react to form Ionic Bonds with metals, but also form Covalent Bonds with other non-metals.  There is one family of non-metals which almost never enter into any chemical reactions, that is the Ideal (or Noble) Gases.\n\nPeriodic table is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 \nThe nature of each element is largely determined by the outermost electrons as they position themselves around the nucleus.  These outermost electrons are called the Valence Electrons, and for most elements, there are eight possible locations for valence electrons in what is called the Valence Shell.  The remainder of the electrons, combined with the nucleus, form the core of the atom.\nMetals typically have fewer than four valence electrons in their Valence Shell.  If they have one valence electron, the core charge will be +1; two valence electrons means a core charge of +2; three valence electrons means a core charge of +3.\nNon-metals typically have more than four valence electrons in their Valence Shell.  If they have seven valence electrons, the core charge will be +7; six valence electrons means a core charge of +6; five valence electrons means a core charge of +5.\nMetals, with their small core charges, have a weak attraction for their valence electrons, and so those electrons are relatively free to move as an electrical current when a voltage is applied across the material.  In fact, these electrons are officially referred to as “Free Electrons”.\n\nImage from Chemistry LibreTexts\nAlso, these loosely-attracted valence electrons can be stripped away, leaving a positive ion which will be attracted to negative ions in an Ionic Bond.  Ionic bonded compounds are typically non-conductive, because what used to be a free electron in the metal has now been bound to the non-metal atom.  The strong attractions between the positive ions and negative ions often result in regularly-defined crystal structures.  However, when dissolved in water, the ions become detached from each other, and can move as charged particles in the water, making the solution conductive.\n\nImage from SlideShare\nNon-metals with their large core charges, have a strong attraction for their valence electrons, so those electrons are not free to move in a current.  As a result, non-metals make good insulators.  When non-metals react with other non-metals, they form Covalent Bonds, in which they share pairs of valence electrons.  Using the Quantum Mechanical model of atoms to explain this, valence electrons occupy orbitals that can be: empty, contain one electron, or contain two electrons.  The most stable condition is for all the orbitals to be filled – i.e. containing two electrons, as is the natural case for the Ideal Gases, and which explains why they do not readily enter into chemical reactions.  Covalent bonds result in atoms with single electrons in their orbitals sharing those electrons with other similar atoms so that both atoms now have full orbitals.  The shared orbitals bind the atoms together tightly.  The electrons in these new compound orbitals are not free to move through the material, so covalently-bonded compounds are, under normal conditions, non-conductive.  They continue to be non-conductive when dissolved in water.\n\nImage from expii.com\nYou’ll notice in the previous discussion statements like “under normal conditions” and “do not readily conduct”.  The fact of the matter is that, given sufficient energy, any electron can be dislodged and can become a Free Electron until it loses its energy and is pulled back into either its original location or another similar location.  In other words, any material can be made to conduct if the electrical field is strong enough to dislodge it or if it absorbs sufficient energy from, say, a photon striking it.\nUp to this point, we’ve discussed Conductors and Insulators.  The real point of this discussion was to get to Semiconductors.  In a small band of the periodic table between the conductors and insulators, you’ll find a group of elements called the semiconductors.  The two most common of these, silicon and germanium, each have four valence electrons, which puts them in the middle between the metals (&lt;4) and the non-metals (&gt;4).  Thus, they exhibit characteristics which are neither metallic nor non-metallic.  They conduct more readily than non-metals, but they enter into covalent bonds with non-metals.  However, their electrons are not as tightly bound into covalent bonds as with typical non-metals, and can be relatively easily become free electrons.  The differences between Insulators, Conductors, and Semiconductors can be pictured using an Energy Diagram.\n\nA lot of energy is required to make an insulator conduct, i.e. to move its electrons out of the valence band into the conduction band as free electrons.  Almost no energy is required to move the electrons in a conductor, as there are already free electrons in the conduction band.  Semiconductors lie halfway between these extremes.\n\nDoped Semiconductor Materials\nSilicon is the most commonly-used semiconductor material, so we’ll focus on it as we move toward an understanding of how the diode works.  Silicon has four valence electrons, and is therefore Tetravalent.\nIn one of its natural conditions, silicon bonds covalently into a tetrahedral crystal structure.  A Lewis Diagram shows a flattened version of the bonds that take place.\n\nPure silicon is also called “Intrinsic silicon”, because it contains no other material than silicon atoms.  This is not only very difficult to achieve, but it also doesn’t bring us any closer to the answer as to how a diode works.  It is much more likely that a crystal of silicon will contain some impurities, and will therefore be “Extrinsic silicon”.  If the bulk of the impurity added to the silicon crystal is the same element, we refer to the result as “Doped silicon”.\n\nN-Type silicon\nIf a very small amount of a five-valence electron, or Pentavalent, dopant is introduced into a silicon crystal, the Pentavalent atoms will be forced into the crystal lattice structure of the silicon crystal, but only four of the electrons will be accepted into the covalent bonds.  That leaves the fifth one as a Free Electron, and, just in metal, this electron will be able to move in a current, making this doped crystal a conductor.  Since the pentavalent dopant has donated a negatively charged Carrier, the new material is referred to as N-Type Material.  The Pentavalent Dopant is referred to as a Donor.  The following Lewis Diagram shows a single Phosphorus atom trapped in a silicon crystal, and its resulting Free Electron.\n     \n\n\nP-Type silicon\nIf a very small amount of a three-valence electron, or Trivalent, dopant is introduced into a silicon crystal, the Trivalent atoms forced into the crystal will not be able to contribute an electron to all four of the surrounding silicon atoms, so there will be an orbital with only one electron in it.  This orbital has an electrical attraction to any available electrons which may temporarily “fall in”, so these are referred to as Holes.  If a source of electrons is connected to one end of the crystal and a positive potential is connected to the other end, electrons will migrate from hole to hole through the crystal, again resulting in a current.  Although the Holes are stationary, they appear to be moving in the opposite direction to the flow of electrons, so this is referred to as Hole Current.  The Trivalent Dopant provide places for electrons to fall into so it is called an Acceptor. The following Lewis Diagram shows a single Aluminum atom trapped in a silicon crystal, and its resulting hole.\n\nIn each of these types of material, it is still possible for electrons in covalent bonds to be ejected by sufficient incoming energy, but this small amount of current is only noticeable if there is little other current.  Consequently, the main form of current is referred to as Majority Current, and the current from the valence electrons is called Minority Current.   So, now we have two new conductive materials.  That still doesn’t answer the question of how the diode works.  The “magic” happens when we combine these two materials.\n\n\n\nThe P-N Junction\nNormally, when we connect two conductors together, we expect to just have a longer conductor.  However, when we bond P-Material to N-Material, we observe some very interesting behavior.  Here’s a block diagram to help with understanding what happens.\n\n\nRight at the connection point, or P-N Junction, the free electrons in the N-Type material are “pulled into” the holes in the P-Type material, in a process called “Recombination”.  That means, at the junction there are no charge carriers, therefore the P-N Junction in its natural state is a non-conductor.\nA net positive charge collects on the N-Type side and a net negative charge collects on the P-Type side of the barrier.  This results in a potential difference (voltage) referred to as the Barrier Potential.\n\nWhat an unexpected result!  Connecting two conductors together has created a non-conductor!\nLet’s investigate the Barrier Potential a bit more.  For silicon junctions, this barrier potential is between 0.5 V and 0.8 V.  Not very big!  In fact, a potential this small is easy to overcome.  Recall, from your Basic Electricity course, that in a circuit with two voltage sources in series, current will flow in the direction dictated by the larger source.  In other words, the bigger source overcomes the potential from the smaller source, and drives current “backwards” through it.\nIn essence, that’s what happens to the P-N Junction when we connect an opposing external voltage source to it.  To do this, we apply the positive side of the source to the P-Type material and the negative side to the N-Type material.  The negative side of the power supply drives electrons into the N-Type side of the junction, and the positive side of the power supply pulls electrons out of the holes in the P-Type material.  With carriers on both sides of the junction, it turns back into a conductor, and current flows.\nForward Biasing is the term used to describe applying an external power supply greater than the barrier potential to a P-N Junction with positive to the P-Type material and negative to the N-Type material.  Forward Biasing results in a flow of current through the junction.  The resistance of the junction will be very low.\nReverse Biasing is the opposite situation.  If an external power supply is applied with the negative side to the P-Type material and positive to the N-Type material, the positive side of the supply draws electrons away from the barrier on the N-Type side, and the negative side of the supply drives electrons into the holes in the P-Type material,widening the barrier and preventing the flow of current.  Since no current flows, the junction appears as an open circuit or a very high resistance, and the voltage across it will match the supply voltage.  In other words, the reverse-biased P-N Junction has a barrier potential essentially equal to the supply voltage.\nReverse Breakdown will occur if the power supply voltage is increased beyond the maximum voltage the P-N Junction can withstand.  At this point, the electrons cascade through the material as they would through a metal conductor, and the resistance becomes very low.  (Reverse Breakdown occurs at different voltages for each device, depending on the way the device has been constructed.)\nThermal Destruction happens very quickly in either the forward or reverse direction if the resulting current is too great.  Recall that P=I2R.  Even though the resistance is low, the squared current part of the calculation can result in a lot of power.\nCircuit Biasing involves placing current-limiting devices, usually resistors, in series with the P-N Junction to limit the current and thereby prevent Thermal Destruction.  Don’t put a P-N Junction directly across a power supply!  You must limit the current using Circuit Biasing!\n\n\nThe Diode\nA single P-N junction, wired with connections to the P-Type and N-Type material, is called a Diode.  Diodes come in lots of different shapes and varieties.  In your parts kit, you have Small Signal Diodes (used to control small currents, usually for logic or radio frequency applications), Rectifier Diodes (used for high-current and often high-voltage applications like power supplies), and Zener Diodes (designed with carefully-controlled Reverse Breakdown voltages for controlling voltages in regulated power supplies).\nThe symbol for a diode is shown below, along with a picture showing a typical diode and the way the polarity is indicated on the package.",
